We taste every batch we make and the Langer name doesn't go on the label until we're satisfied the juice is perfect. With no added sugar (Not a low calorie food.

Doing our part for sustainable and responsible farming: As a California-based company, we are always conscious of the amount of water we use to grow our crops. That's why, at our orchards in California's Central Valley, we capture the water released from our fruit during pressing and concentrating and use that water as a substantial part of the irrigation of our trees.
