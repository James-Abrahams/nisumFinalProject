We craft our rum by going out of our way to find the best Caribbean rums to make Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum. The ones that make the cut are blended together to create the ideal base for our unmatched recipe of natural spices.
Our 92 proof spirit is historically accurate. In fact, the term “proof” comes from the method of reassuring sailors that their rum has not been watered down. A ship's captain would take a ladle of rum, add gunpowder and ignite it to provide his crew with a ""proof"" of the integrity of their rum.
Sailor Jerry Rum was created in honor of Norman “Sailor Jerry” Collins, the undisputed father of the old school tattoo and a true independent spirit.

Hendrick's is an unusual gin created from eleven fine botanicals. The curious, yet marvelous, infusions of rose & cucumber imbue our spirit with its uniquely balanced flavor resulting in an unimpeachably smooth and distinct gin.
The Hendrick’s Rickey is a beloved, refreshing and easy-to-make cocktail. However, Ms. Lesley Gracie, chooses to drink it with club soda, elderflower liqueur and garnished with 3 thinly sliced cucumber rounds.
Hand-crafted on the Southwest coast of Scotland in the decidedly un-ginnish town of Girvan, tiny batches of only 500 lovely litres are produced at a time, which gives Ms. Lesley Gracie, our Master Distiller and the inventor of Hendrick’s Gin, greater control of her careful artistry.
Hendrick’s Gin is created via an absurdly inefficient, yet quite glorious process. In essence, to make one gin, we first create two. One on an old-fashioned pot still, yielding a rich and intricate spirit. The other on along-necked Carter Head, producing a delicate, more refined spirit. Each still is infused with an unusual symphony of 11 botanicals. The gins from the two stills are then married together and graced with refreshing infusions of Rose and Cucumber.
This odd method of making gin enables Hendrick’s to taste light, yet intriguingly complex. The result is a wondrously refreshing gin with a delightfully floral aroma, elevating any cocktail and all occasions.

Roku is the premium Japanese craft gin created by the House of Suntory in Osaka, Japan. Crafted by Japanese artisans with meticulous attention to detail, Roku is the perfect balance of flavors. Its precise balance is testimony to Japan’s renowned craftsmanship. Suntory has a long history of making gin, dating back to 1936, and Roku is the modern embodiment of Suntory’s mastery of this process. In Japanese, Roku translates as “six”. Roku follows the concept of shun – the tradition of enjoying every food and drink in its proper season, only when those foods are at the peak of their flavors. Inside every bottle of Roku are six very special botanicals sourced in Japan. Each of the Japanese botanicals are harvested in their ideal season and from the best growing areas in Japan to ensure the utmost freshness and flavor. The six Japanese botanicals are combined with eight traditional gin botanicals – juniper berry, coriander seed, angelica root, angelica seed, cardamom seed, cinnamon, bitter orange peel, and lemon peel – for an authentic gin taste. A unique multiple distillation process brings out the best in each botanical.",960472408,images.albertsons-media.com/is/image/ABS/960472408?$ecom-product-card-desktop-jpg$&defaultImage=Not_Available

Hendrick’s Lunar, the second limited edition release from Master Distiller Ms. Lesley Gracie’s Cabinet of Curiosities, is a delightfully smooth and alluring gin that offers a delicate balance of gentle spice, subtle floral notes with a soft citrus finish. It is best enjoyed during casual nights at home and is a curious companion for sundowners and starry nights with friends. Undeniably celestial, Ms. Gracie devised Lunar under a waxing crescent moon and its cosmic properties are pervasive from packaging to taste profile. 
Hendrick’s Lunar is best enjoyed in light & crisp cocktails such as the Lunar Cosmic Cooler – our uniquely Hendrick’s take on a classic Gin Rickey.
Hendrick’s Gin is created via an absurdly inefficient, yet quite glorious process. In essence, to make one gin, we first create two. One on an old-fashioned pot still, yielding a rich and intricate spirit. The other on along-necked Carter Head, producing a delicate, more refined spirit. Each still is infused with an unusual symphony of 11 botanicals. The gins from the two stills are then married together and graced with refreshing infusions of Rose and Cucumber.
Hand-crafted on the Southwest coast of Scotland in the decidedly un-ginnish town of Girvan, tiny batches are produced at a time, which gives Ms. Lesley Gracie, the inventor of Hendrick’s Gin, greater control of her careful artistry.
Please enjoy the unusual responsibly.",970064090,images.albertsons-media.com/is/image/ABS/970064090?$ecom-product-card-desktop-jpg$&defaultImage=Not_Available

The Langer Story: Growing up in the '50s, we drank fresh juice every day. Dad was our head juicer and we were his official tasters. Together, we discovered which fruits made the best-tasting juice and blends. Today our family keeps the same high standard. We taste every batch we make and the Langer name doesn't go on the label until we're satisfied the juice is perfect. With no added sugar (Not a low calorie food. See nutrition facts for sugar and calorie content) or sweeteners, the result is a juice like no other. Completely delicious and nutritious - just the way Dad taught us. No sugar (Not a low calorie food. See nutrition facts for sugar and calorie content) or sweeteners added. Pasteurized. Sustainability: The best tasting juices start with, well, the best fruit. Doing our part for sustainable and responsible farming: As a California-based company, we are always conscious of the amount of water we use to grow our crops. That's why, at our orchards in California's Central Valley, we capture the water released from our fruit during pressing and concentrating and use that water as a substantial part of the irrigation of our trees. We are committed to farming in a sustainable and responsible manner. www.langers.com. Our bottles are BPA free. Please recycle.

Flavor notes: Lemon peel, tropical, dank. The iconic west coast style IPA. Stone IPA: This is the IPA that initiated Stone Brewing's reputation for hops and exposed a budding world of craft beer enthusiasts to our bold style as an emerging brewery. Long before IPAs were craft brewing's most prominent beer style, this beer was in our lineup, not because of public demand but because we simply loved it so much. Distinguished by bright hop fruitiness, piney vibrancy and pronounced, tantalizing bitterness, stone IPA has stood tall as the epitome of the west coast style IPA since 1997. After all, this is the hop-forward IPA that's inspired countless others, including our own legacy of IPAs that have collectively earned stone a reputation as one of the most passionate and artful hop-driven breweries on the planet.

Sugar In The Raw Sugar 100% Na... Packets - 100 Count,Sugar,3.59,"Condiments, Spice & Bake",5.0,"Turbinado Cane Sugar, Packets

Certified Vegan. vegan.org. Vegan. Naturally gluten free food. Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. Non-GMO. Rooted in Brooklyn, the In The Raw sweetener family business began long before the natural food movement. We started with Sugar In The Raw in 1970, sourced where the tropical sun meets rich, fertile soil and cool mountain waters. There are only a precious few places in the world where all the conditions are perfect for nature's own sweetener. Sugar In The Raw Premium Turbinado Sugar is made from natural, non-GMO sugar cane. Its natural molasses produces a distinctive taste and gives a golden color to the large jewel-like crystals (because sugar cane is natural, crystals may cluster and color may vary). Use Sugar In The Raw in place of ordinary refined sugar, and savor the delicious old-fashioned taste! Since introducing our original Sugar In The Raw in 1970, we have branched out into other sweetener sources found in nature giving us Agave In The Raw, Monk Fruit In The Raw, Stevia In The Raw, Organic White Sugar In The Raw and Organic Stevia In The Raw. No matter how you sweeten, the In The Raw family has just the right sweet for every taste. Sweeten a tea, a cup of coffee. Hot or cold. Sprinkle it on cereal, add some sparkle to your muffins. Cook and bake with it too. Whatever you do, just do it with Sugar In The Raw. Enjoy more wholesome options from the make of In The Raw brand sweeteners. InTheRaw.com.

Oatly Frozen Dessert Vanilla - 16 OZ,Oatly,5.99,Frozen Foods,5.0,"Vanilla Frozen Dessert

The simple things in life are often the best. A sunset, a glass of cold water, playing a kazoo, reading copy on a website. And of course, vanilla non-dairy frozen dessert made from oats.

If you can taste a pod of vanilla without picking up any influences from the frosting on little Jimmy's birthday cake, you can be pretty sure the entire Oatly lineup is going to be great. But let's keep the focus on vanilla. The flavor is bold and handsome with this one, made with real vanilla seeds, natural vanilla flavor and a hint of sea salt—all of which complement the subtlety of the oats perfectly. Feeling like a midnight snack? Pull the carton out of your freezer at 11:59 and scoop away without any sitting-out-on-the-counter nonsense. Because a 12:22 a.m. snack isn't a thing.""",970008606,images.albertsons-media.com/is/image/ABS/970008606?$ecom-product-card-desktop-jpg$&defaultImage=Not_Available

Amy's Margherita Pizza - 13 Oz,Amy's,9.99,Frozen Foods,5.0,"Pizza, Hand-Stretched Crust, Margherita

Thin crust topped with mozzarella. Certified organic by Quality Assurance International (QAI). No GMOs: Genetically engineered ingredients. From our home to yours. When Amy's mother, Rachel, and uncle, Joel, were kids back in the '60s, their parents took them to Italy. The first thing they wanted to eat when they got there was, of course, pizza - in Naples they found what they were looking for-not exactly like the ones back home, but delicious and recognizably pizza. Forty years later, when Amy's grandmother first tried Amy's Margherita Pizza, she said, somehow this tastes familiar. When our cook explained that this pizza was based on the original Pizza Napoletana, she laughed and said, of course - this is like what we ate in Naples. The simple sauce is made with organic tomatoes, and the crust is thinner than our usual crust. Best of all are the toppings - organic tomatoes, along with mozzarella, Parmesan and organic basil. The simple, crisp flavors of this classic pizza are hard to beat. Family owned since 1987. After the birth of our daughter Amy in 1987, we found there was little time to prepare the quality homemade food we normally ate. Realizing there were others like ourselves, we started Amy's Kitchen to prepare delicious meals for those who care about the food they eat but are often too busy to cook. We use only the finest ingredients and prepare them with the same careful attention in our kitchen as you would in your own home. No meat, fish, shellfish, poultry, eggs or peanuts are ever used in any Amy's products.  Amys.com. how2recycle.info.  We love to cook for you. Amys.com.

I started cauliflower so that you'll never have to choose between taste, health, or convenience again - or spend hours making DIY chicken tender;) Gail Becker, Founder & CEO Caulipower.

At Beyond Meat we believe there is a better way to feed our future and that the positive choices we all make, no matter how small, can have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet. By shifting from animal to plant-based meat, we can positively impact four growing global issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources, and animal welfare.

Our process is simple. We source the building blocks of meat directly from plants. Using heating, cooling and pressure, we create the fibrous texture of meat from plant-based proteins. Then, we mix in fats, minerals, and carbohydrates to replicate the appearance, juiciness, and flavor of meat. The result? Uncompromisingly delicious plant-based burgers, sausage, and more, no sacrifice required.",970114350,images.albertsons-media.com/is/image/ABS/970114350?$ecom-product-card-desktop-jpg$&defaultImage=Not_Available
