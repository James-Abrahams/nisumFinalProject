More than 20 years ago, we became the first company to supply organic milk nationwide--and we’ve remained committed to the organic movement ever since. Our USDA Certified Organic products are made with non-GMO ingredients, from cows that are given no antibiotics, no persistent pesticides, and no added hormones.* We strive to do good by our cows, too: they spend much of their time out in the pasture where they feel most at home, and graze on a diet that includes organic grass. It’s all part of our commitment to making better choices for ourselves, our cows, and our planet. *No significant difference has been shown between milk from rbST-treated & non rbST-treated cows.; More than 20 years ago, we became the first company to supply organic milk nationwide--and we’ve remained committed to the organic movement ever since.

Until then, we'll keep telling everyone about cranberries any way we can. For more about Heidi and the Dempze Family, visit www.oceanspray.com. Grower Owned since 1930.

Flavor notes: Lemon peel, tropical, dank. The iconic west coast style IPA. Stone IPA: This is the IPA that initiated Stone Brewing's reputation for hops and exposed a budding world of craft beer enthusiasts to our bold style as an emerging brewery. Long before IPAs were craft brewing's most prominent beer style, this beer was in our lineup, not because of public demand but because we simply loved it so much. Distinguished by bright hop fruitiness, piney vibrancy and pronounced, tantalizing bitterness, stone IPA has stood tall as the epitome of the west coast style IPA since 1997. After all, this is the hop-forward IPA that's inspired countless others, including our own legacy of IPAs that have collectively earned stone a reputation as one of the most passionate and artful hop-driven breweries on the planet.

Certified Vegan. vegan.org. Vegan. Naturally gluten free food. Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. Non-GMO. Rooted in Brooklyn, the In The Raw sweetener family business began long before the natural food movement. We started with Sugar In The Raw in 1970, sourced where the tropical sun meets rich, fertile soil and cool mountain waters. There are only a precious few places in the world where all the conditions are perfect for nature's own sweetener. Sugar In The Raw Premium Turbinado Sugar is made from natural, non-GMO sugar cane. Its natural molasses produces a distinctive taste and gives a golden color to the large jewel-like crystals (because sugar cane is natural, crystals may cluster and color may vary). Use Sugar In The Raw in place of ordinary refined sugar, and savor the delicious old-fashioned taste! Since introducing our original Sugar In The Raw in 1970, we have branched out into other sweetener sources found in nature giving us Agave In The Raw, Monk Fruit In The Raw, Stevia In The Raw, Organic White Sugar In The Raw and Organic Stevia In The Raw. No matter how you sweeten, the In The Raw family has just the right sweet for every taste. Sweeten a tea, a cup of coffee. Hot or cold. Sprinkle it on cereal, add some sparkle to your muffins. Cook and bake with it too. Whatever you do, just do it with Sugar In The Raw. Enjoy more wholesome options from the make of In The Raw brand sweeteners. InTheRaw.com.

Thin crust topped with mozzarella. Certified organic by Quality Assurance International (QAI). No GMOs: Genetically engineered ingredients. From our home to yours. When Amy's mother, Rachel, and uncle, Joel, were kids back in the '60s, their parents took them to Italy. The first thing they wanted to eat when they got there was, of course, pizza - in Naples they found what they were looking for-not exactly like the ones back home, but delicious and recognizably pizza. Forty years later, when Amy's grandmother first tried Amy's Margherita Pizza, she said, somehow this tastes familiar. When our cook explained that this pizza was based on the original Pizza Napoletana, she laughed and said, of course - this is like what we ate in Naples. The simple sauce is made with organic tomatoes, and the crust is thinner than our usual crust. Best of all are the toppings - organic tomatoes, along with mozzarella, Parmesan and organic basil. The simple, crisp flavors of this classic pizza are hard to beat. Family owned since 1987. After the birth of our daughter Amy in 1987, we found there was little time to prepare the quality homemade food we normally ate. Realizing there were others like ourselves, we started Amy's Kitchen to prepare delicious meals for those who care about the food they eat but are often too busy to cook. We use only the finest ingredients and prepare them with the same careful attention in our kitchen as you would in your own home. No meat, fish, shellfish, poultry, eggs or peanuts are ever used in any Amy's products.  Amys.com. how2recycle.info.  We love to cook for you. Amys.com.

At Beyond Meat we believe there is a better way to feed our future and that the positive choices we all make, no matter how small, can have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet. By shifting from animal to plant-based meat, we can positively impact four growing global issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources, and animal welfare.

Our process is simple. We source the building blocks of meat directly from plants. Using heating, cooling and pressure, we create the fibrous texture of meat from plant-based proteins. Then, we mix in fats, minerals, and carbohydrates to replicate the appearance, juiciness, and flavor of meat. The result?
